# FrontDoor Health — Provider Profile System Prompt

# Task

Design and implement a reusable Provider Profile page system for the FrontDoor Health website.

The website targets premium small-to-medium private healthcare practices and should feel:
- modern,
- calm,
- premium,
- conversion-oriented,
- highly readable for patients,
- and visually differentiated from outdated hospital websites.

The goal is to replace dense physician biography pages with modern profile experiences optimized for:
1. patient trust,
2. conversion,
3. readability,
4. physician credibility,
5. mobile usability.

The design language should match the existing FrontDoor Health aesthetic:
- premium healthcare editorial design,
- soft typography,
- calm photography,
- muted colors,
- subtle luxury,
- whitespace-heavy layouts,
- elegant modern minimalism.

Avoid:
- corporate hospital aesthetic,
- dashboard-style UI,
- dense text walls,
- heavy borders,
- overly technical layouts,
- generic stock medical design.

# Existing Site Context

The practice homepage already contains:
- hero section,
- services,
- provider cards,
- contact/scheduling CTA.

Each provider card should include:
- provider photo,
- provider name,
- specialty,
- short descriptor,
- CTA button:
  "View Profile"

Clicking the CTA navigates to:
`/providers/[slug]`

Examples:
- `/providers/goutham-dronavalli`
- `/providers/rahul-vasireddy`

# Technical Requirements

- reusable provider page template/component,
- reusable provider card component,
- structured provider data model,
- responsive layout,
- SEO-friendly metadata,
- semantic HTML,
- accessible typography/color contrast.

OR existing project stack if detected.

# Core UX Principles

Patients skim.

The page should prioritize:
1. provider photo,
2. specialty,
3. conditions treated,
4. trust signals,
5. appointment CTA.

NOT:
- long biographies,
- academic CV formatting,
- giant text blocks,
- excessive medical jargon.

Use:
- concise sections,
- strong visual hierarchy,
- chips/cards,
- whitespace,
- typography,
- short readable paragraphs.

Every provider page should have:
- clear CTA above the fold,
- sticky mobile CTA,
- trust-building without clutter.
